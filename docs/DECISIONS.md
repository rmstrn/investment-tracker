# Engineering decisions log

A running log of non-obvious engineering decisions: what was decided, why,
and when we plan to revisit. Newest entries at the bottom.

## 2026-04-19 — Dependency upgrade policy

Until post-MVP (after first production deploy), we PIN current majors for all
tooling. Dependabot is configured to auto-PR minor/patch only; majors are
bulk-upgraded once per quarter in a dedicated "upgrades" sprint.

Reason: pre-launch stability > latest features. Mid-build major bumps cost
more than they return.

Owner of quarterly upgrade pass: project lead.
First review: post-MVP launch + 2 weeks.
